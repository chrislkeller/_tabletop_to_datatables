### Demo: tabletop to datatables

This repo's location has [changed](https://github.com/chrislkeller/projects.chrislkeller.com/tree/master/demos/tabletop_to_datatables), though the zip file added to this repo contains the same code from the link above...

In addition, [Scott Pham](http://www.scottpham.com/) has created a version of this [project](https://github.com/scottpham/tabletop-to-datatables) that uses the latest version of DataTables and removes a lot of deprecated code.
